<h2>Special Rules</h2>

<p>Bay Area Media Softball League generally follows the Amateur Softball Association slow-pitch rules, with a few exceptions of our own:</p>
<br>
<p>1.	The Game</p>
<br>
<p>1.1.	Each team is responsible for paying the umpires $15 prior to the start of the game.</p>
<br>
<p>1.2.	All games will consist of nine innings with a 2-hour time slot to complete the game. No inning may start 10 minutes prior to the next game time slot, unless the score is tied. Then 1 additional inning may be played. If the game ends in a tie, each team will be awarded 1 League Standing point (see Rule 1.26, below). Teams may agree to take batting or fielding practice prior to the official start of the game. However, if practice time occurs after the official start time of the game, the total allotted time for the game will be reduced.</p>
<br>
<p>1.3.	Games may be forfeited if a team is not ready to play by fifteen minutes after the scheduled starting time. Alternately, teams may simply agree to play a shorter game. If no umpire is available at game time, teams should provide their own umpires until somebody qualified arrives.</p>
<br>
<p>1.4.	If a team forfeits a game due to not having the required number of players within the 15- minute start time, that team must pay a $30 forfeit fee to the league prior to their next game. The $30 will be used to pay the umpires for the forfeited game.</p>
<br>
<p>1.5.	To avoid a forfeit, a shorthanded team may pick up players from other teams in the league. However, the shorthanded team must have a minimum of 6 of their own players, and may then only add additional players up to 9 total players. If the shorthanded team has 7 of their own players, they may add additional players up to 10 total players. If the team’s own players arrive, they must be inserted in place of the added players from other teams. A team must have at least 8 total players or the game will be considered a forfeit.</p>
<br>
<p>1.6.	When women are batting, the 11 inch "women's league" ball shall be used by the pitcher.</p>
<br>
<p>1.7.	There is no catch and carry rule. If a player catches the ball before the ‘boundary line’ he or she can cross the out of bounds line with their momentum. If the ball is already outside of the ‘boundary line’ when the player catches the ball, it is called a dead ball.</p>
<br>
<p>1.8.	At game time teams should agree which side of the field will be their dugout. If both teams favor the same side of the field, the decision is the home team’s choice, unless the umpire agrees that both teams can use the same side of the field. If the umpire does not agree the home team’s choice will prevail.</p>
<br>
<p>1.9.	The strike zone includes all slow-pitches that arc between six and twelve feet and land either on any part of the plate or on the league mat behind the plate. Illegal pitches (high or "flat") may be taken for balls or hit, if the batter chooses. Umpires will call illegal pitches as soon as they see them. If a batter does not hear the umpire call "illegal", "flat" or "high" before the pitch reaches the plate, the batter should not assume that the pitch is illegal. No disputes are allowed on balls and strikes.</p>
<br>
<p>1.10.	Once a batter reaches two strikes (no matter how they are acquired) s/he may then hit one foul ball and stay at bat. The second foul after the second strike constitutes a strikeout.</p>
<br>
<p>1.11.	On plays at first base, the fielder has access to the first inside (white) base, and must tag the inside base on a force play. The runner must try to avoid colliding with or stepping on the fielder. The runner is allowed to step on the outside base or next to the base in foul territory on any play. The batter-runner does not have to touch the base. They only have to break the plane of the baseline leading to second base, similar to the rule at home on a score. Intentionally contacting the fielder who is making or anticipating a play on first base is an automatic out.</p>
<br>
<p>1.12.	Although some base-path contact is unavoidable, runners are specifically forbidden from trying to "take-out" fielders by sliding or running into them. A runner who has been forced out should leave the fielder a clear line to throw to the next base by sliding, running toward the outfield or whatever else is appropriate. If the umpire judges that a runner has not tried to get out of the way of a potential throw, he may call the batter or another runner out.</p>
<br>
<p>1.13.	At home plate, all plays are force plays. The catcher must catch the ball and have complete control (no juggling) while standing on the plate (not the mat) to make a putout. To be safe, the runner must cross a continuation of the first base line, drawn from the plate to the backstop, before the catcher has control of the ball while touching the plate. If the runner touches home plate or the strike mat, he/she will be immediately called out by the umpire, and the ball is dead. The only exception to this rule is if a play has occurred that resulted in a dead ball.</p>
<br>
<p>1.14.	A line is drawn across the base path two thirds of the way from third base to home plate. A runner who touches this line is committed to scoring. If the runner returns to third base, s/he is still liable to be forced out at the plate until the completion of the play. The play at home must be a force out. Tagging the runner in between the commit line and the home plate line will not result in an out.</p>
<br>
<p>1.15.	If a man, in front of a women, is intentionally walked (based on the umpire’s judgment), the man is awarded second base. If the man has at least one strike, an intentional walk will not be called.</p>
<br>
<p>1.16.	On plays at the plate, the catcher (regardless of gender) must make the first attempt at the put out. Another fielder may back-up the catcher or field a carom off the backstop and make the play, but the catcher must make the first attempt at the ball. This is to prevent fielders other than the catcher from taking throws to the plate and depriving the (usually female) catchers of a chance to make what would normally be their play.</p>
<br>
<p>1.17.	In the spirit of the league, the umpire may also void a put-out in the field if, in his/her judgment, a male fielder shows deliberate chauvinism in taking a play away from a female fielder. In this (rare) case, the runners, including the batter, receive two bases on an outfielders' play, or one base on an infielders'. Umpires should be conservative in applying this rule as BAMSL players often forget to call balls clearly or to listen to the calls of their teammates, regardless of gender, and may wind up stealing plays for reasons that have little or nothing to do with sexism.</p>
<br>
<p>1.18.	If a batter steps on home plate or the strike mat when batting a ball, the batter is automatically out and a dead ball is ruled. No base-runners may advance.</p>
<br>
<p>1.19.	Because of the short right-field fence at Parkside Playground we have a concern for children playing on the playground equipment just past the fence. Therefore, any ball hit over the fence (fair or foul) is an automatic out, the ball is dead and no base-runners may advance. Any balls hit in the leafy part of the trees all around the outfield will be considered automatic homeruns, unless the tree is on the outer side of the right field fence. In that case the batter is automatically out. A team may have unlimited homeruns hit into the trees. Any ball to the right of the bathrooms and to the left of the playground fence that rolls or bounces beyond the path is a homerun. Any ball to the left of the bathrooms that rolls or bounces beyond the path is considered a dead ball and the runner will be awarded 1 extra base from where the runner was located when the ball crossed the path. A player in the field attempting to play a ball crossing the path should raise both arms and immediately stop pursuing the ball at the time the ball crosses the path. Any fly balls hit over the path will be considered a home run. The roof of the bathrooms is considered a homerun. A ball hit against the wall of the bathrooms or the base of a tree is considered a live ball.</p>
<br>
<p>1.20.	Crossing the entire outfield, approximately 20 feet behind where the infield dirt meets the outfield grass, an arched imaginary line will be inserted, using cones on both foul lines to demark the curve of the line. At all times the outfielders may not play in front of that imaginary line until a pitched ball is batted.</p>
<br>
<p>1.21.	Coaches may agree to waive or modify rules before the game. They must inform the umpire of their decision and they may not alter the rules designed to enhance safety or the participation of women.</p>
<br>
<p>1.22.	On all calls, the umpire's judgment is final. Only the coach may formally question a call or ruling. The coach may appeal to the umpire to change his call and, if the other coach agrees, the umpire should go along, but s/he is not required to. Problems with rule interpretations or attitude should be taken to the commissioner, not aggravated on the field.</p>
<br>
<p>1.23.	Official protests will only be accepted on rule interpretations. Official protests must be announced at the time of the incident. Subsequent to the game, the Official Protest, including a $30 processing fee, must be submitted to the Commissioner in writing prior to the next week's games. If the protest is sustained, the $30 processing fee will be returned to the team.</p>
<br>
<p>1.24.	The umpire’s judgment is final. During the game, there are no appeal processes, other than those described in 1.22 and 1.23 above, to the Commissioner or the Umpire Coordinator if they are present, to over-turn the umpire’s decision.</p>
<br>
<p>1.25.	If a player is ejected from the game by the Umpire, the player is required to leave the park within 10 minutes or their team forfeits the game. A suspension of the player may be levied at the discretion of the commissioner.</p>
<br>
<p>1.26.	League standings will be determined by “League Standing Points.” Two League Standing Points will be awarded to each winning team per game. One League Standing Point will be awarded to both teams when a tie occurs.</p>
<br>
<p>2.	The Teams</p>
<br>
<p>2.1.	A maximum of ten players may be in the field at one time. The minimum age for players in a BAMSL game is 16. Of the ten players on the field, three must be women at all times. A team may play with fewer than seven men if it wishes, but it may not play without three women without the consent of the opposing manager. If a team only has two women, then they must play with only eight fielders, unless waived by the opposing team. The minimum breakdown of men and women batting is the following:</p>
<br>

		<td align="center">% Women</td>

<p align="center">* requires approval of opposing manager</p>
<br>
<p>2.2.	Batting orders must include three out of every 10 batters be women. Batting eight men in a row will result in an automatic out to the eighth man. All players who play in the field must bat. Players who do not play in the field may bat. However, a minimum of 30% of the lineup must be women. Coaches may substitute players freely, as in football or basketball. However, if a player is replaced by another player, they must wait until the entire batting order bats before they are eligible to bat, again. Example: Bob bats sixth in the lineup. After the forth inning he is replaced by Jim in the batting order. He must wait until all batters bat after Jim before Bob can be re-inserted in the batting order.</p>
<br>
<p>2.3.	Certain injured players may require a pinch runner. The runner may be inserted after the batter reaches first base. The intent of this rule is to permit an injured player to continue to play. It is not intended to allow a team to replace a good hitter, but a slow runner with a faster base runner after the batter gets a hit. If a team has enough healthy players to start the game, then all base runners should run for themselves. If a team needs an injured player to have a complete line-up, then that player may have a pinch runner after they get on base, and continue in the line-up. The Spirit of the League concept should provide direction for teams and managers on this rule. If a player is injured during the game, a runner may be used as the injured player bats. In this case, the runner stands touching the center of the backstop facing the pitcher. She/he may run at the crack of the bat. The use of a designated runner only needs to be announced before the player bats, NOT prior to the game.</p>
<br>
<p>2.4.	There are no roster restrictions during the regular season. To be eligible for playoffs, a player must play in at least four games with the team. In order to verify eligibility, coaches should keep an up-to-date scorebook including first and last names of players.</p>
<br>
<p>2.5.	Shoes with metal cleats or spikes are not permitted.</p>
<br>
<p>2.6.	A list of illegal bats has been issued and published by the ASA and provided to each team's manager.
They are also available at www.asasoftball.com. Those bats may not be used during any BAMSL game. Additionally,
all bats used during gameplay must have an ASA stamp. Each team's manager is responsible for ensuring that ALL players on 
his/her team does not use an illegal bat. If a batter is found using an illegal bat he will be called out, 
immediately ejected from the game, and the bat confiscated. Under such circumstances, a one-time warning 
will be issued to the team. If at any point during the remainder of the season (including playoffs) any 
member of the team with one warning is found using an illegal bat, the game will be immediately forfeited 
to the opposing team. Any subsequent use of illegal bats in games thereafter will continue to result in an 
immediate forfeit.</p>
<br>
<p>2.7.	Players are allowed to eat, drink, smoke and carry-on while on the sidelines but not on the field. They are, however, required to treat the other players, the umpires, the fans and other park users with courtesy and respect.</p>
<br>
<p>2.8.	Team managers must provide a written list of all players eligible for their playoff roster by the Saturday before playoffs begin. Rosters can be submitted to the league commissioner or emailed to all league managers. The manager must be able to prove eligibility by making score books for all regular season games available for review by a league representative.</p>
<br>
<p>2.9.	For all playoff games up until the championship game, the home team is the team with the higher regular season standing. If there is a tie in standing points, the team with the better head to head record will be home team. Should the head to head record also be tied, the team with the fewer runs allowed across the entire regular season will be home team. For the playoff championship game, the home team is the team still in the winners' bracket. Should the team in the winners' bracket lose and a second championship game be needed, the home team for that game will be determined by a coin flip.</p>
