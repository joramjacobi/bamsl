<h2>BAMSL 2013 - Our 36th Year!
</h2>

<p>BAMSL (Bay Area Media Softball League) was started in 1978 with the ceremonial first pitch thrown by Joe DiMaggio. It is a private league not associated with San Francisco Recreation & Parks in any way. Although some teams may have a connection to the media, it is not a requirement.</p>
<br>
<p>Currently, all regular season games are played at Parkside Playground, 28th Avenue @ Vicente, in the Sunset district of San Francisco. Each game lasts either 2 hours or 9 innings, and are played with a minimum of 3 women. Games are on Sunday with starting times of 10:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 2:00 PM, and 4:00 PM. Some scheduling accommodations can be made prior to the start of the season, but teams should plan on playing in all time slots during the season. The regular season usually runs from March to September, with a double elimination tournament at the end. All teams qualify for the tournament. BAMSL's guiding principle is known as "The Spirit of the League."</p>

<h3>The Spirit of the League</h3>

<p>The Spirit of the League
The Spirit of the League supersedes all other rules. This concept says that we are all friends and that our purpose is to have fun together. Anything that impedes it is bad, regardless of what other leagues do. We trust, respect and enjoy each other, even in the heat of competition. That's the main difference between BAMSL and more rigid leagues.
